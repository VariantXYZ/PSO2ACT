A plugin for use with Advanced Combat Tracker to parse PSO2 damage logs.

Damage log CSV format: timestamp, instanceID, sourceID, sourceName, targetID, targetName, attackID, damage, IsJA, IsCrit, IsMultiHit, IsMisc, IsMisc2

You'll probably need at least Visual Studio 2012 to compile this. Also ACT, apparently the ACT executable itself is a reference.
